    </h3>
    <p>
      In the lower levels of <em><b>Hawkins National Laboratory</b></em
      >, a scientist in a lab coat runs down a
      <strong>dark <em>hallway</em></strong
      >, frantically pushing buttons and trying to operate an elevator. When the
      elevator arrives, the man enters and is seemingly safe then suddely
      something growls above him. Terror fills the man's face, his eyes widened.
      As the doors close, he is violently pulled upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, four middle schoolers, Mike, Dustin, Lucas, and Will, play
      Dungeons & Dragons in Mike's basement. The four boys want to play a while
      longer, as they have just encountered the fearsome Demogorgon, but Mike's
      mother insists it's time for them to go home. While Will and Dustin are
      riding their bikes home, they decide to race so that if Will wins, he gets
      Dustin's X-Men. As Will pushes ahead, he rides onto "Mirkwood", a road
      near Hawkins Lab. He is frightened by a mysterious figure in the middle of
      the road and crashes his bike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will hears something in the distance, which frightens him and sends him
      running home. However, the mysterious creature chases him. He tries to
      call for help, but the phone is not wor king. As the creature breaks in
      through his front door, Will runs and hides in a shed in the backyard of
      his house. He shakily loads a gun to fend off whatever is coming for him.
      The shed's dangling light bulb begins to flicker; a strange, guttural
      growl is heard, and Will vanishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, Will's mother, Joyce, and his older brother, Jonathan,
      are unable to find him. Joyce calls Mike's house to see if Will stayed
      there, but Karen tells her that he left the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Hawkins Middle School, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas are a little surprised
      that they haven't seen Will yet. They have a run in with bullies before
      heading to class. Meanwhile, at Hawkins High School, Nancy, Mike's sister,
      makes out with Steve in the bathroom and they make plans to meet up later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce hurries to the police station to talk to Chief Hopper, who she hopes
      can help find her son. As Hawkins is a quiet, sleepy town, Hopper
      questions Joyce's claims and doesn't take her too seriously. Hopper's
      first instinct is to question her ex-husband Lonnie, but Joyce insists
      that any potential involvement of his in Will's disappearance is unlikely
      - nonetheless, she agrees to call him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Hawkins Lab, a team of scientists, including Dr. Brenner, suit up in
      protective suits before entering the quarantined underground subsystem.
      There, they find strange biologic growth spreading - originating from a
      mysterious fracture in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young girl is dressed in a hospital gown, with a completely shaven head,
      wanders into Benny's Burgers. Benny Hammond, the owner, catches her in the
      kitchen stealing fries.
    </p>
    <p>
      After class at Hawkins Middle, the boys become overwhelmed with excitement
      when their science teacher reveals that the Heathkit ham shack he ordered
      has been delivered. However, the school principal and Chief Hopper
      interrupt to question them about Will's way home the previous night. He
      tells them to go straight home after school and to not go biking around
      looking for Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flashback scene, Joyce is in the woods at Castle Byers surprising
      Will with tickets to see Poltergeist . In the present time, Joyce and
      Jonathan are at the fort, looking for Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back at Benny's Burgers, Benny, showing some charity despite her trying to
      steal from him, feeds the girl and attempts to make conversation, but she
      keeps quiet. He realizes she has the digits "011" tattooed on her left
      forearm. When Benny inquires about the number's meaning, the girl
      indicates that the number refers to herself. While she eats, Benny steps
      away to make a phone call to social services; he assumes the girl has been
      abused. The girl becomes irritated by a noisy fan. She stares intensely at
      it, lowering her head - suddenly, the music on the radio becomes heavily
      distorted - and the fan jolts and stops. The girl relaxes and resumes
      eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Mirkwood, Hopper and his officers Powell and Callahan are out on the
      road where Will crashed his bike. They find it, tipped over and abandoned,
      by the trees on the side of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce tries to call Lonnie, but is hung up on by his girlfriend, Cynthia.
      The cops show up with Will's bike. Hopper looks around the house for clues
      and is drawn to the shed. The light flickers, and he is startled by
      Callahan entering the shed. He tells them they need to organize a search
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike and his family sit around the dinner table. Mike wants to go looking
      for Will, but his mother says no. Nancy asks her mother to go study at her
      friend Barb's house. She says that nobody leaves the house until Will is
      found. Nancy gets upset, and in a fight with Mike he reveals her new
      boyfriend.
    </p>
    <p>
      A search party is out in the woods at night looking for Will. Scott Clarke
      tells Hopper that Will is a great student. It is revealed that Hopper's
      daughter Sarah died a few years back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucas and Mike talk on their Supercoms. They discuss how Will was willing
      to put himself in danger to help the group while playing D&D the night
      before, and agree to meet up to look for him. Mike spots Steve trying to
      sneak into Nancy's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benny is doing dishes in the kitchen and tells the girl that a smile looks
      good on her. A woman claiming to be from Social Services arrives to pick
      her up. Benny invites the woman into the diner, and when his back is
      turned, the woman shoots him. Benny falls dead to the floor while a number
      of agents arrive to collect the girl. She quickly becomes agitated and
      uses her telekinetic abilities to kill two of the agents before escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys are out searching for Will, while Nancy and Steve study in secret
      in her room. Steve tries to seduce Nancy, but she rejects his advances.
      They return to their reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce and Jonathan go through family photos. Jonathan breaks down, feeling
      guilty about his brother's disappearance. Joyce tells him it's not his
      fault and claims that Will is close, that she can feel it. They choose a
      picture for his "missing child" flyers. Joyce receives an ominous, static
      call on her home phone. Joyce says to Jonathan that she can hear Will
      breathing. There's static, some growling, and the lights flicker. The
      phone surges with electricity, briefly electrocuting Joyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      While searching for Will in the rain, Dustin wants to turn back. Mike and
      Lucas disagree, moving forth with their plan. They hear rustling in the
      bushes and find the girl.
